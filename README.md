# Public-health-app

# THIS IS A WORK IN PROGRESS, ITS AN ADDAPTATION OF A SERVICE THAT WAS UNDER CONSTRUCTION so alot of infrastructure is already in place

- Its opensource in the hope that people will use it, trust/ promote and use it in the rest of africa where we dont have access

## This application utilizes android background running services + geo-location + geo-fencing as well as submit data to a public api

## The point being people will share the information of whether they have any pneumonia psymtoms and the app will track them and release the data to the public to the people around the user. this will include the places where the user has visited in the past 14 days and if two points meet and spends some time together it flags that negative user that they may have been infected

## The app will also provide a feed of daily tips of home workout, public chat wall for all users to chat about their area, ideally users will be clustered by radius around them and ofcourse radii can overlap across regions

## COMMUNICATION IS PRIMARIRY THROUGH SMS because most prople have sms access and with the croud sourced data its possible to send notifications even when users are offline/ as a service updating them about their area, used by chiefs and other grassroots people
